**PlsComeBack** is a fully-featured web application that is meant to help manage **Fablabs**.

🗺 It was made by 8 great IT french students, from [ISEN](https://www.junia.com/fr/junia/programme-grande-ecole-isen/) Lille, France, for a school project.

The application was developed using [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/)

We had some **mandatory instructions**, and some **additional features** to develop (not mandatory)

### 🧰 Requirements (mandatory)
- 🧩 Using Node.JS to develop the app
- 📅 integration of a booking and borrowing system
- 🌐 [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for the database 
- 🖥 Separated user & admin pages
- 📷 QR code management system (on laptop and mobile phone)
- 📖 Personal history of borrowing and booking 

### ✨ Features (not mandatory)
- ✅ database dockerized
- ✅ homemade API to connect to the DB (in [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com))
- ✅ the Front-end and Back-end have been separated
- ✅ Selenium tests to ensure the fully working status of the front-end (the tests of the API were made with a [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) collection of requests)
